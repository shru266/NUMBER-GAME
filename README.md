# NUMBER-GAME
I created an interactive guessing game that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user is prompted to enter their guess, and I provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number or reaches a specified limit of attempts. It allows the user to play again.
